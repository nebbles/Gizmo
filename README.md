## Acknowledgement

In 2016, Dr. Ariadna Blanca Romero produced the initial online teaching material for Gizmo, stored in [this repository](https://github.com/Starignus/PythonPractise).

In 2017, the material was overhauled by Dr. Jing Sheng Pang, Elena Falomo, and Ben Greenberg in [a new forked repository, which is now legacy content](https://github.com/ImperialDyson/Gizmo-Legacy). 

In 2018, Ben Greenberg rewrote and updated much of the material, and migrated all teaching into a complete website format built with Sphinx. [This repository](https://github.com/nebbles/Gizmo) stores this latest iteration.

Acknowledgement is also made to the following for their useful online resources:

* Sparkfun Learn
* Raspberry Pi Foundation
* Raspberry Pi GPIO developers
