Intro to Git & GitHub
=====================

What is a VCS?
==============

A version control system (VCS) is one that allows the author to track changes to a file over a period of time. It timestamps information and allows multipl copies of the same work to be compared and merged together. Nowadays 'git' is the go-to VCS for software and many other types of media.

Understanding Git
=================

To understand Git, there are a number of good tutorials out there to get you started. If you feel like you want to learn from the source material, you can `check that out here <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics>`_. However we recommend that you learn from the videos produced by The Coding Train.

For a quick overview, we recommend you check out `just a simple guide for getting started with git<http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/>`_.

Cheatsheet
----------

If you need a quick cheatsheet for Git commands, `Tower has a pretty good one put together <https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/>`_

The following graphic, also made by Tower, is a guide to how the Git workflow works:

Using a graphical interface for Git
===================================

There are a number of programs that you can use to visually interact with your Git repository. This makes working with Git *very easy*.

- `GitHub Desktop <https://desktop.github.com>`_ (free)
- `Sourcetree <https://www.sourcetreeapp.com>`_ (free)
- `GitKraken <https://www.gitkraken.com>`_ (free)
- `Tower <https://www.git-tower.com/mac>`_ (discounted for students)

GitHub
======

GitHub and Bitbucket are the two biggest public services for storing VCS repositories. We recommend you use the official `GitHub guides <https://guides.github.com>`_. These will help you transistion your understanding of using Git locally, into using GitHub to host your files.
