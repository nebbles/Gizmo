Why Raspberry Pi?
=================

The Raspberry Pi definitely performs best when there are heavy calculations into play but also is great for:

- More processing power, so the Raspberry can come to the rescue.
- Graphical applications
- Big Data projects
- Internet or network connectivity projects (IoT)
- The need for USB peripherals such as a web cam
- ... and many more applications!

To choose between the two there's is this `Make:zine article <http://makezine.com/2015/12/04/admittedly-simplistic-guide-raspberry-pi-vs-arduino/>`_ that can help you out.

Alternatives to the Raspberry Pi
================================

Here are some alternatives to the Raspberry Pi, although it's important to remember that the Pi really is the best in its field with many *many* examples available around the internet.

- `Arduino Yun <https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-yun>`_ it is an Arduino with WiFi connection capabilities ideal for IoT
- `Intel IoT Developer Kit <https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/dev-kit>`_
- `Photon <https://store.particle.io/>`_ very tiny Wifi enabled board
- `Beaglebone <http://beagleboard.org/bone>`_ it is a Raspberry Pi competitor with some analog pins functionality
- `ESP8266 <http://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp8266ex/overview>`_
